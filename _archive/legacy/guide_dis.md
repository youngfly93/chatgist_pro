1. Layout & Spacing
❌ Today	✅ Why / How to improve
Hero, feature cards, “About” and footer each float in lots of white space but don’t share an underlying rhythm.	- Apply an 8 pt (or 4 pt) spacing system across the whole page so paddings, margins and gaps feel intentional.
- Constrain the main column to a max-width (e.g. 1200 px) and centre it; this reduces “drift” on ultra-wide screens.
Two feature cards feel disconnected from the hero.	- Add a subtle, consistent drop-shadow or an outlined section container around them.
- Consider keeping all content inside a single vertical “card” below the hero on large screens; on tablets / phones stack the cards vertically.

2. Visual Hierarchy
❌ Today	✅ Why / How to improve
The gradient hero looks nice, but there’s no immediate CTA.	- Place a clear primary button under the subtitle (“立即体验” / “Try it now”) to guide users into either “智能助手” or “基因筛选”.
Subtitle text is small, cards’ headings compete with body text.	- Define a type-scale (e.g. [32 / 24 / 20 / 16 / 14 / 12 px]) and stick to it.
- Give H1 (hero) ≈ 40-48 px, H2 (card titles) ≈ 24 px.
Floating action icons on the right are ambiguous.	- Add tooltips on hover / focus.
- If they’re global actions (e.g. feedback, scroll-top, dark mode) consider grouping them in one FAB menu; if they’re section-specific place them near their targets.

3. Colour & Branding
❌ Today	✅ Why / How to improve
Only one accent colour (blue-purple gradient).	- Define primary, secondary, neutral, success / error tokens.
Example: primary #2F6CCA, secondary #4B9CD3, neutral #F5F7FA.
- Use the secondary tint for hover states so buttons / links feel interactive.
The gradient card and feature cards have different corner radii / shadows.	- Pick one corner radius (e.g. 24 px) for all cards.
- Use a consistent elevation level (e.g. box-shadow: 0 4 px 12 px rgba(0,0,0,.05);).

4. Typography & Microcopy
Font pairing – try a geometric sans for headings (Poppins, Inter) and a humanist sans for body (Noto Sans / PingFang SC).

Line-length – keep paragraphs ≤ 70 characters for readability.

Voice – ensure CTA labels are action-oriented (“进入 AI 助手 →” instead of “进入数据群”).

5. Interaction & Motion
Hover states – cards can scale + shadow on hover (transform scale(1.02)); buttons can animate background-color.

Focus outlines – add custom but accessible outlines for keyboard navigation.

Small delays – fade-in hero and cards with 150–250 ms easing for a premium feel.

6. Accessibility Quick-wins
Test colour contrast (WCAG AA) for white text on the gradient – you may need font-weight: 600 or a slightly darker gradient.

Add aria-label to the gene-input field, icons, and floating buttons.

Ensure all interactive components are reachable via <kbd>Tab</kbd>.

7. Responsive Checks
Breakpoints: 1280 / 1024 / 768 / 480 px.

On mobile, stack hero → single column cards → about.

Swap the 3-column nav (logo + links) to a drawers / hamburger above 768 px.

Quick “1-Day” Wins
Add a primary CTA button to the hero.

Normalise corner radius + shadows for hero & cards.

Increase card title font size to improve scan-ability.

Hook up tooltips to right-side floating icons.

Apply a uniform 8 pt spacing grid for paddings / margins.

Tackle those first and your landing will already feel far more deliberate—then you can iterate on colour palette, motion, and deeper accessibility. Let me know if you’d like prototypes, CSS snippets, or component examples!
